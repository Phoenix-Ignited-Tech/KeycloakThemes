This defaultconf directory contains the default theme conf files for each theme for the Keycloak account area. We do not include the base theme files.<br></br>
If a theme does not support the Keycloak account area it is not listed. In this case there is only one Keycloak theme that supports the Keycloak account area and that is the keycloak.v3 theme.
